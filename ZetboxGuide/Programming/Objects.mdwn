Objects

### ObjectClass

Zetbox knows four kinds of Types, all derived from *DataType*:

[[!table header="no" data="""
ObjectClass    | Type for Zetbox Object Classes
Interface      | Type for Zetbox Interfaces
Enumeration    | Type for Zetbox Enumerations
CompoundObject | Type for Zetbox Object Classes
"""]]

#### DataType

This is the abstract base class for all Zetbox Types. It provides the
necessary infrastructure to describe a Type.

[[!format cs """
public interface DataType
{
    string Name; 
	string Description;

    IList<Property> Properties; 
	ICollection<Method> Methods;

    Icon DefaultIcon; 
	ICollection<InstanceConstraint> Constraints;
}
"""]]

[[!table header="no" data="""
Name        | The name of the *DataType*. Note that this name has to be a valid C# name. A *Constraint* protects this.
Description | Each Type should have a description. This description is used for documentation purposes.
Properties  | Each Type can have Properties (except *Enumeration*)
Methods     | Each Type can have Methods (except *Enumeration*)
DefaultIcon | Each *DataType* can have a default icon
Constraints | A *Constraint* checks the validity of an instance. If any constraint throws an error nothing will be committed.
"""]]

#### ObjectClass

*ObjectClass* is *the* defining class for Zetbox Objects.

[[!format cs """
public interface ObjectClass : DataType
{
    ObjectClass BaseObjectClass; 
	ICollection<Interface> ImplementsInterfaces;

    string TableName;

    bool IsAbstract; 
	bool IsFrozenObject; 
	bool IsSimpleObject;

    ViewModelDescriptor DefaultViewModelDescriptor; 
	ControlKind RequestedKind;

    ICollection<AccessControl> AccessControlList;
}
"""]]

[[!table header="no" data="""
IsAbstract    | The *ObjectClass* is marked as abstract
IsSimpleObject| The *ObjectClass* is marked as a simple, non complex object. Set it to true for all classes that have no inheritance and less enough and simple properties to edit them in grids and/or lists. This will prevent all list view models from opening such an object directly. Also the *ObjectBrowser* will not provide any interface.
"""]]

### Relation

A *Relation* defines the relationship between two Objects. Every Object
can have zero or more *Relations*.

An example of a *Relation* is the relation between *Project* and
*Tasks*. One *Project* can have zero or more *Tasks*. One *Tasks* must
have a *Project*.

### Modeling a relation

A Relation can be defined by creating an object of type *Relation* and
two *RelationEnd* objects. This can be done by

* creating an Relation Object.
* invoking the *Create Relation* method on an *ObjectClass* instance.

*RelationEnd* objects will be created automatically.

Relations are edited in the *Relation Editor*. The *Relation Editor* is
a custom *FullObjectView* created by us.

### Attributes of a relation

![image](Rel_Attributes.png)

A *Relation* has these attributes:

[[!table header="no" data="""
Description | A text property used to describe the current relation
Module      | The *Module* which is introducing the current relation
Storage     | The *StorageType* of the current relation
Verb        | A verb used to name the current relation. The verb is used in conjunction with the role names of the *RelationEnd* objects to model a unique relation name. This relation name will be used e.g. for the database FK Contraint name.
A           | The *RelationEnd* A of the current relation
B           | The *RelationEnd* B of the current relation
"""]]

A *RelationEnd* has these attributes:

[[!table header="no" data="""
AParent            | *Relation* object if this *RelationEnd* is the A-Side of the current relation. Otherwise *NULL*
BParent            | *Relation* object if this *RelationEnd* is the B-Side of the current relation. Otherwise *NULL*
HasPersistentOrder | Specifies that the list is ordered. Applies only to lists
Multiplicity       | The *Multiplicity* of the current *RelationEnd*
Navigator          | An optional *Navigator*
RoleName           | Name of the role of the current *RelationEnd*
Type               | *ObjectClass* to which the current *RelationEnd* points
"""]]

There are four *StorageTypes* defined:

[[!table header="no" data="""
MergeIntoA | The relation information is stored with the A-side database table
MergeIntoB | The relation information is stored with the B-side database table
Replicate  | The relation information is stored on both sides of the relations database tables
Separate   | The relation information is stored in a separate database table
"""]]

There are three *Multiplicities* defined:

[[!table header="no" data="""
ZeroOrOne  | Optional Element (zero or one)
One        | Required Element (exactly one)
ZeroOrMore | Optional List Element (zero or more)
"""]]


### 1:n Relation

A *Project* can have zero or more *Tasks*. A *Task* may have one
*Project*.

![image](Rel_1_n_Project_Tasks.png)

The *Relation* object would be:

    Storage = MergeIntoB
    Verb = has

The *RelationEnd* A object would be:

    AParent = Relation
    BParent = NULL
    HasPersistentOrder = false
    Multiplicity = ZeroOrOne. If a Task must have a Project then One.
    Navigator = Navigator to Tasks. The result would be a collection of Tasks (ICollection<Task>)
    RoleName = Project
    Type = Task instance of type ObjectClass

The *RelationEnd* B object would be:

    AParent = NULL
    BParent = Relation
    HasPersistentOrder = false
    Multiplicity = ZeroOrMore
    Navigator = Navigator to the parent Project. The result would be a reference to a Project
    RoleName = Tasks
    Type = Project instance of type ObjectClass

![image](ScreenShot_Rel_Project_Task.png)

### n:m Relation

A *Project* can have zero or more *ProjectMembers*. A *ProjectMember*
can be assinged to zero or more *Projects*.

![image](Rel_n_m_Project_Member.png)

The *Relation* object would be:

    Storage = Seperate
    Verb = has

The *RelationEnd* A object would be:

    AParent = Relation
    BParent = NULL
    HasPersistentOrder = true
    Multiplicity = ZeroOrMore.
    Navigator = = Navigator to Persons. The result would be a list of Persons (IList<Person>)
    RoleName = Projects
    Type = Person instance of type ObjectClass

The *RelationEnd* B object would be:

    AParent = NULL
    BParent = Relation
    HasPersistentOrder = true
    Multiplicity = ZeroOrMore
    Navigator = = Navigator to the assigned Projects. The result would be a list of Projects (IList<Project>)
    RoleName = Member
    Type = Project instance of type ObjectClass

![image](ScreenShot_Rel_Project_ProjectMember.png)

### 1:1 Relation

A *Relation* must have a *RelationEnd* A. A *RelationEnd* may have a
AParent *Relation* if it’s a A *ReleationEnd*.

![image](Rel_Attributes.png)

The *Relation* object would be:

    Storage = MergeIntoA
    Verb = hasA

The *RelationEnd* A object would be:

    AParent = Relation
    BParent = NULL
    HasPersistentOrder = false
    Multiplicity = ZeroOrOne
    Navigator = = Navigator to RelationEnd. The result would be a reference to a RelationEnd
    RoleName = Relation
    Type = RelationEnd instance of type ObjectClass

The *RelationEnd* B object would be:

    AParent = NULL
    BParent = Relation
    HasPersistentOrder = true
    Multiplicity = One
    Navigator = = Navigator to the assigned Relation. The result would be a reference to a Relation
    RoleName = A
    Type = Relation instance of type ObjectClass

### Properties

[[!format cs """
public interface Property 
{
    string Name;
	
	bool EditableInGrid;
}
"""]]

[[!table header="no" data="""
Editable in Grid | This is an override for the inline editing behaviour for grid and list controls. The default behaviour is to evaluate if the referenced *ObjectClass* is a simple object or not.
"""]]
