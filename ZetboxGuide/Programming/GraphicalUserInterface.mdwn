Graphical User Interface
========================

Like other subsystems, the GUI core is designed to be platform
independent. Therefore only the *outermost* shell contains toolkit
specific code.

Architecture
------------

The GUI is modeled after the Model-View-ViewModel architecture. The
*Model* represents the underlying data structures and business logic. It
is provided by the generated classes from the actual datamodel.

*View Models* provide display specific functionality like formatting,
transient state holding and implementing the user’s possible actions.
They always inherit from *Zetbox.Client.Presentables.ViewModel*. Common
implementations reside in the *Zetbox.Client.Presentables* namespace.

*Control Kinds* are representing a way how *ViewModels* would like to be
displayed. For example:

-   as a TextBox

-   as a DropDownList

-   as a CheckBox

-   as a RadioButtonList

*Control Kinds* are simply a sort of enumeration items. They do not
provide any services. *ControlKinds* can be put into a hierarchy. That
enables the infrastructure to choose another view if a certian
*ControlKind* is not implemented in a Toolkit.

Finally, *Views* (editors and displays) are the actual components taking
care of showing content to the user and converting the users keypresses
and clicks into calls on the view models interface. Views are
toolkit[^1] specific and reside in the toolkit’s respective assembly.

This architecture decouples the actual functionality of the Model and
the View Model completly from the inner workings of a toolkit and
thereby maximise the reuse of code between different clients.

Plumbing
--------

The three layers are connected through two sets of descriptors and
*ControlKinds*. The *ViewModelDescriptor*s contain information about the
available View Models and their preferred way of being displayed.

public interface ViewModelDescriptor

Zetbox.App.GUI.ControlKind DefaultKind; Zetbox.App.GUI.ControlKind
DefaultDisplayKind; Zetbox.App.GUI.ControlKind
DefaultGridCellDisplayKind; Zetbox.App.GUI.ControlKind
DefaultGridCellKind;

string Description;

Zetbox.App.Base.TypeRef ViewModelRef;

*ViewDescriptor*s contain information about controls which are capable
of displaying certian *ControlKinds*.

public interface ViewModelDescriptor Zetbox.App.GUI.ControlKind
ControlKind; Zetbox.App.Base.TypeRef ControlRef; Zetbox.App.GUI.Toolkit
Toolkit;

### Some implemented ViewModels

*DataObjectViewModel*
:   represent a complete data object; provide standardised access to
    properties; provide non-standard ViewModels with additional
    functionality; selected via *ObjectClass.DefaultViewModelDescriptor*

*BaseValueViewModel*s
:   represent a specific piece of simple data (strings, DateTimes); Data
    can be the a Propertiy, MethodResults or simply a Value; Properties
    and Parameter of Methods selects their *ViewModel* via their
    *ValueModelDescriptor* Property;

ActionViewModel
:   represent a Method which can be invoked in the UI.

ObjectEditor.WorkspaceViewModel
:   This ViewModel implements all featurs of and Object Editor. This
    includes Cancel, Save or selecting the current item.

### Control Kind

The *ControlKind* specifies the toolkit-independent kind or type of
control that should display a given Presentable. While the View
specifies the Control Kind it implements the Presentable requests a
specific Kind to be displayed via the
*PresentableModelDescriptor.DefaultControlKind* value.

In special situations this default value can be overridden. For example,
the metadata of a property contains a *RequestedControlKind* which is
used instead of the *DefaultControlKind* when present. If there is no
View matching the requested Kind, the infrastructure may either fall
back to the default control kind, or use a similar control kind from
higher up in the hierarchy.

Typical kinds of controls:

WorkspaceWindow
:   the top-level control within which all user interaction happens

SelectionTaskDialog
:   a dialog letting the user select something from a longer list of
    items

ObjectView
:   display the modeled object in full

ObjectListEntry
:   display the modeled object as item in a list

TextEntry
:   lets the user edit a property as text

IntegerSlider
:   lets the user edit a number with a slider

YesNoCheckbox
:   a simple yes/no checkbox

YesNoOtherText
:   radio buttons allowing one to select either "yes", "no" or a
    TextEntry field

ExtendedYesNoCheckbox
:   a checkbox with additional text as label

The kind of a control is identified by the *ControlKind*’s class. The
hierarchy between different kinds of controls is modeled with
inheritance.

### Views

Their descriptors list the available Views by Toolkit and which
ControlKind they represent. *View Descriptors* can define which
*ViewModel*s (or Interfaces to ViewModels) are supported.

Resolving ViewModels
--------------------

*ViewModels* are resolved by the *IViewModelFactory*

public interface IViewModelFactory

void ShowModel(ViewModel mdl, bool activate); void ShowModel(ViewModel
mdl, Zetbox.App.GUI.ControlKind kind, bool activate);

void CreateTimer(TimeSpan tickLength, Action action); string
GetSourceFileNameFromUser(params string[] filter); string
GetDestinationFileNameFromUser(string filename, params string[] filter);
Toolkit Toolkit get;

// Create Models TModelFactory CreateViewModel\<TModelFactory\>() where
TModelFactory : class; TModelFactory
CreateViewModel\<TModelFactory\>(Zetbox.API.IDataObject obj) where
TModelFactory : class; TModelFactory
CreateViewModel\<TModelFactory\>(Zetbox.API.ICompoundObject obj) where
TModelFactory : class; TModelFactory
CreateViewModel\<TModelFactory\>(Zetbox.App.Base.Property p) where
TModelFactory : class; TModelFactory
CreateViewModel\<TModelFactory\>(Zetbox.App.Base.BaseParameter p) where
TModelFactory : class; TModelFactory
CreateViewModel\<TModelFactory\>(Zetbox.App.Base.Method m) where
TModelFactory : class; TModelFactory
CreateViewModel\<TModelFactory\>(System.Type t) where TModelFactory :
class;

// IMultipleInstancesManager void
OnIMultipleInstancesManagerCreated(Zetbox.API.IZetboxContext ctx,
IMultipleInstancesManager workspace); void
OnIMultipleInstancesManagerDisposed(Zetbox.API.IZetboxContext ctx,
IMultipleInstancesManager workspace);

*ViewModel*s can be created directly if the requested *ViewModel* is
known. Some *ObjectClasses* (ObjectClass, Property, Method, Parameter,
etc.) can declare a more specific *ViewModel*. Use a more specific
*CreateViewModel* overload in such a case.

The most obvious example is *Property*. There is a need for different
*ViewModel*s for a *StringProperty* vs. *ObjectReferenceProperty*. Each
*ViewModel* for displaying Properties derives from a very basic
*BaseValueViewModel*.

IntProperty
:   is displayed by a NullableStructValueViewModel of type int

BoolProperty
:   is displayed by a NullableStructValueViewModel of type bool

DecimalProperty
:   is displayed by a NullableStructValueViewModel of type decimal

StringProperty
:   is displayed by a ClassValueViewModel of type string or
    MultiLineStringValueViewModel

DateTimeProperty
:   is displayed by a NullableDateTimePropertyViewModel

ObjectReferenceProperty
:   is displayed by a ObjectReferenceViewModel,
    ObjectCollectionViewModel or ObjectListViewModel

Create a specific *ViewModel* by calling:

mdlFactory.CreateViewModel\<WorkspaceViewModel.Factory\>().Invoke(ctx);

Create a *ViewModel* for a *Property* by calling:

ViewModelFactory.CreateViewModel\<BaseValueViewModel.Factory\>(prop).Invoke(DataContext,
prop.GetValueModel(Object));

Create a *ViewModel* for a *IDataObject* by calling:

ViewModelFactory.CreateViewModel\<DataObjectViewModel.Factory\>(obj).Invoke(DataContext,
obj);

The *ViewModelFactory* will look up the *IDataObject*s type and tries to
find it’s *ObjectClass*. Then it looks up the *ViewModelDescriptor* and
creates the *ViewModel*.

Using ViewModels
----------------

### DataObjectViewModel

The *DataObjectViewModel* wraps a whole *IDataObject* in a ViewModel.

The most important Properties and Methods are:

PropertyModels
:   A read only list of all known *BaseValueViewModels* fetched from the
    *ObjectClass*.

OnPropertyModelsCreated()
:   Called after the *PropertyModels* list has been created. In a
    derived, custom *ViewModel* this event can be used for additional
    *ValueViewModel* setup routines. E.g. adding custom commands to
    *ObjectReference\*ViewModels*.

PropertyModelsByName
:   Dictionary of *BaseValueViewModels* with the property name as the
    key.

OnPropertyModelsByNameCreated()
:   Called after the *PropertyModelsByName* dictionary has been created.

PropertyGroups
:   A read only collection of property groups. See
    *CreatePropertyGroups* for more information.

CreatePropertyGroups
:   Property groups are created based on the properties summary tags.
    Due to the fact, that properties can have more than one summary tag,
    properties may appear in more than one property group. Properties
    with no summary tags appears in the “Uncategorised” group. Note,
    that currently summary tags may not contain spaces as the space is
    defined as the seperator. You can override this method to add custom
    property groups.

    protected override List\<PropertyGroupViewModel\>
    CreatePropertyGroups()

    var result = base.CreatePropertyGroups();

    var relListMdl =
    ViewModelFactory.CreateViewModel\<InstanceListViewModel.Factory\>()
    .Invoke(DataContext, () =\> DataContext,
    typeof(Relation).GetObjectClass(FrozenContext), () =\>
    DataContext.GetQuery\<Relation\>() );

    var lblMdl =
    ViewModelFactory.CreateViewModel\<LabeledViewContainerViewModel.Factory\>().Invoke(DataContext,
    "Relations", "", relListMdl); var propGrpMdl =
    ViewModelFactory.CreateViewModel\<SinglePropertyGroupViewModel.Factory\>().Invoke(DataContext,
    "Relations", new ViewModel[] lblMdl ); result.Add(propGrpMdl);
    return result;

PropertyGroupsByName
:   Dictionary of *PropertyGroups* with the group name as the key.

IsReadOnly
:   Specifies, that the underlying object should be read only.

    This sets every property read only.

### ValueViewModel

### Highlighting

Every *ViewModel* supports highlighting. Highlighting is the visual
representation of an object state. It is the *ViewModel* decision how to
translate the business state to the visual state. Therefore, the
*ViewModel* exposes an property *Highlight*.

public class Highlight : INotifyPropertyChanged HighlightState State
get; set; string GridBackground get; set; string GridForeground get;
set; FontStyle GridFontStyle get; set; string PanelBackground get; set;

Visual states (*HighlightState*) are a fixed enumeration, described as
the most common verbs like Good, Neutral, Bad, Archived, Deactivated,
Active, Output, Input, Calculation, Info, Warning, Error, Fatal, Note, …

Each of this *HighlightState* will be translated by the *Toolkit* into
it final visual representation. E.g. Warning will be rendered in Grid
with an yellow background color and a black foreground color. Error will
be rendered in a Grid with an red background color and a white
foreground color. This color schema makes it easier for the user to
identify an object business state quickly. Therefore a *Toolkit* should
not implement another color schema.

Sometimes, there is a need to use custom colors. E.g. if the sales
volume should be formatted from green (high) smoothly to red (low).
Something like a balanced score card. In this case the *ViewModel*
should return custom colors in the *GridBackground*, *GridForeground*,
etc. properties.

Thus, that every ViewModel supports highlighting it is possible to color
the whole line plus color some cell individually.

The *HighlightState* is not only used in Grids and Lists. It is also
used in panels. The color schema may be slightly different from the
girds color schema. E.G. it makes no sense to color a panels background
in a light gray color to signal the Deactivated state. It should be a
darker gray. If the panels background color should be customized
override the *PanelBackground* property.

Implementation

### Implementing a ViewModel

### Implementing a WPF View

* [[InputStates]]

Asynchronous Loading
--------------------

Not yet implemented.

To facilitate low-latency user interfaces, the ViewModels should
implement a thin proxy layer to delegate all potential blocking
operations onto a worker thread. To keep programming this layer easy,
there are a few helper classes and a few constraints on the available
interface mechanisms as well as a consistent contract over all compliant
ViewModels.

There are only three ways to communicate over the *thread gap*:

1.  accessing a property

2.  calling a *void* function (with not *out* or *ref* parameters)

3.  having an *EventHandler* called

All compliant ViewModels provide a *IsLoading* property that signifies
whether any background processing is active. While this property is
true, any value read from a property may be stale and/or about to be
replaced. Changes to the visible value of a property are always reported
via the *PropertyChanged* event from the *INotifyPropertyChanged*
interface. This should suffice for enabling binding frameworks to show
current values to the user: When reading a value from a property, a
cached value is returned immediately and optionally a refresh is
triggered, which in turn may cause a PropertyChanged event a little bit
later.

In the case of time-dependent values, the ViewModel has to take care to
establish a periodic refresh timer[^2] which triggers PropertyChanged
events when new values arrive.

Similarily, methods called on the ViewModel do not actually do their
work immediately, but delegate to the background worker thread. Results
either show up automatically through changed properties and the
PropertyChanged event or via specialized events.

### Thread Safety

The ViewModel is designed to be accessed from a single UI thread. Due to
the low latency of the public interface, this should pose no problem.
The ViewModel internally takes care of all synchronization with the
worker thread. Due to the asynchronicity of the underlying data it is
quite possible that the values of properties change while a method on
the UI thread is currently executing.

### Automatic Generation

Due to the restricted set of operations allowed, the proxy can and
should be automatically generated, freeing the ViewModel from the
intricacies of synchronizing and delegating across thread boundaries.
Special needs like callback parameters and time-dependent values have to
be communicated via special Attributes.

[^1]: Toolkits are GUI libraries like WPF, GTK\# or Windows Forms but
    can also be implemented by more complex providers such as ASP.NET.

[^2]: Todo: such a timer should be provided by the infrastructure for
    platform dependent refreshing
